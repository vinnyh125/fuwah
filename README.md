# üçú Fu-Wah Chinese Restaurant Website ü•°
Website and general hub for Fu-Wah Chinese Restaurant. The site has all pertinent information relating to Fu-Wah and is designed completely from the ground up using html, css, javascript/jquery, and https://www.netlify.com/ for hosting and other web services. Some information that the site includes are the location, hours, various popular menu items, and redirects to supported online ordering vendors.

# Goals & Ideas
Coming into this project, I had limited/no experience with languages such as html, css, and javascript. I knew I wanted to do something to learn and practice these technologies because they're a huge part of the computer science space. On one hand, I wanted to make something meaningful, and on the other hand, I wanted to make sure whatever I was making was practical. As a result, I chose to create a site for my family's restaurant. I had no idea about how I would approach the design, or anything about the site to be honest, but I like to think about it as all part of the web developing journey :^).

# User Interface
I have no experience in UI/UX design so... no idea about the user interface. I just decided to make everything black and white (bland and boring, I know), but I think it's fine since the site serves as a hub for a bunch of other sites for online ordering anyway. Something I did choose to change was the font: I chose montserrat (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) which I originally thought looked too round and unprofessional, but the more I looked at it, the more I liked the font. For starters, the rounded-ness of the font played well with the whole sans-serif font-family and offers a sleek minimalism that wasn't present with the old font (Times New Roman). I also played around with css' line-height and letter-spacing properties to make the text more accessible and readable. Finally, I centered all the text and added some simple javascript animations to make everything smoother and less jagged and rigid.

# Mobile-Compatibility
Originally, the site was not mobile-friendly whatsoever. The navigation bar at the top of the site would line-break and cover up text, and the whole deal was problematic and annoying. To combat this issue, I used media queries to change the navigation bar's appearance on devices whose width was smaller than 768 px. I'm quite happy with how it looks on mobile!

# Outcome
Overall, this project has been incredibly informative and helpful in aiding me through standard web-design and web-development practices. Take a look for yourself! (visit: www.fuwahgarden.com)
